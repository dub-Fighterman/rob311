"""
ROB311 Bluetooth Controller

This script initializes the PS4 controller using the `PS4InputHandler` class and demonstrates 
how to use it in a runtime environment. The script logs input signals from the controller 
in real-time for testing and debugging purposes.

Key Features:
- Initializes the PS4 controller.
- Runs the controller in a separate thread for asynchronous input handling.
- Logs inputs from thumbsticks, triggers, and shoulder buttons in real-time.

Example Usage:
1. Run this script directly to test PS4 controller inputs:
    python rob311_bt_controller.py
2. Use the logged inputs for debugging or integrating with robotics systems.
